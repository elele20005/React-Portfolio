## User Story

I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

## Description React + JavaScript + Vite

` },`

 *Navigate to the `vite.config.js` file and edit the export object so that it looks like this example*:     
 `export default defineConfig({`        
 `plugins: [react()],`      
 `server: {`

## Usage
`Vite` is use to build your portfolio, which will include the following:


A single `Header` component that appears on multiple pages


A single `Navigation` component within the header that will use Link components from `react-router-dom` to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio


A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section


A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

To start the application, run:

command: `npm run dev`

## Tests
To test the application, run the React + Vite and verify that outputs match expected results based on various inputs


## Additional Requirements
This Challenge combines many of the skills covered so far. In addition to the user story and acceptance criteria, we've provided some guidelines to help get started. Your application should use Vite for building your Portfolio. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

command: `npm run build` 

**This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules**
